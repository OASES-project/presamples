presamples
====================

|Build Status| |Coverage Status|

 Package to write, load, manage and verify numerical arrays, called `presamples`.
 
 Initially written for scenario analysis and for the reuse of sampled data in Monte Carlo Simulations
 in the [Brightway LCA framework](https://brightwaylca.org/).
 
 However, the presamples package is software-generic and built on the datapackage	standard	by	
 Open	Knowledge	Foundation. 
 
 Presamples are useful anytime values for named parameters or matrix elements need to be saved and reused.
 
 **Documentation**: Better documentation is on its way, in the meantime, please consult the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/PascalLesage/presamples/blob/master/docs/presamples%20docs%20and%20examples.ipynb)
 
 **Examples**: More examples are on their way, in the meantime please consult the Jupyter Notebooks [here](https://github.com/PascalLesage/presamples/tree/master/docs/examples)
