# presamples

 Package to write, load, manage and verify numerical arrays, called `presamples`.
 
 Initially written for scenario analysis and for the reuse of sampled data in Monte Carlo Simulations
 in the [Brightway LCA framework](https://brightwaylca.org/).
 
 However, the presamples package is software-generic and built on the datapackage	standard	by	
 Open	Knowledge	Foundation. 
 
 Presamples are useful anytime values for named parameters or matrix elements need to be saved and reused.
