presamples
======================================

Presamples is used to write, load, manage and verify *presample arrays*.

Presample arrays refer to arrays of values that specific parameters can take on. Presamples allows these arrays
to be generated *ahead* of their use in a particular model. This is useful if:

- Generating these values is computationally expensive and there is no need to recalculate them with each model run;
- We want to reuse the *same* values every time a model is solved.

Presamples was initially built specifically for parameters used in life cycle assessment (LCA), and hence has many
methods specifically geared at making the integration of presamples in LCA models easy. However, it can be used in any
other type of model.

Presample's source code is `hosted on github <https://github.com/PascalLesage/presamples/>`_.
