Brightway-presamples
====================

This library allows you to use pre-generated values in LCA calculations. It builds on top of the `Brightway LCA framework <https://brightwaylca.org/>`__.

Pre-generated arrays can be used in improve LCA calculations in many ways:

    * Seeded pre-sampled Monte Carlo values are reproducible
    * Pre-generated static or stochastic values can be generated by complex, non-linear models, capturing system dynamics more accurately
    * Pre-sampled Monte Carlo values can capture correlations between parameters, such as between characterization factors, or between input and outputs (e.g. fuel use and CO2 emissions)
    * Direct use of population data avoids losses from fitting data to distributions

`Brightway-presamples` also introduces the idea of *campaigns*, which allow for the systematic exploration of choices. See more TODO.
