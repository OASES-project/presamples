NOTES FOR CHRIS

- Peewee has a script to run tests so users can make sure they installed correctly:
http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/installation.html#running-tests
Should we consider doing this?

- installing.rst:
  - The part on "sudo install" was ripped off peewee documentation. Relevant do you think?



.. topic:: Example usage

  The fuel consumption of a ship is a function of several uncertain parameters: water resistance coefficients,
  effective wake, propeller efficiency, etc.

  If the fuel consumed during shipping is just one of many other parameters
  in a model you want to solve, you probably don't want to include all the parameters contributing to fuel consumption
  directly.

  Presamples allows you to store an array of fuel consumption values, and to reuse these directly and efficiently
  in another model downstream.



Store samples of a parameter used in a model in presample packages

Store samples of the model outputs in presample packages

Stored samples of model outputs can be used in non-parametric models
Non-parametric models make strong assumptions about independence

Create and use variations of the same presample package








Since the

Keeps models simple by replacing submodels with aggregated values
Can update input data values: using other models or data to calculate underlying models and input data


Data used in models can be:
  - measured
  = the output of another model

When measured,
When looking for input data, we may therefore



In some fields, such as industrial ecology, models often are are incorporate a vast number of models

Data used in models is prone to uncertainty. Parameter values is itself often

Model aggregation
Availability of input parameter values
Possibility to easily replace input parameter values


Keeps trace of the input parameters used to evaluate some output
Allows the aggregated output to be used directly in other models
